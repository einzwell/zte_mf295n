# ZTE MF295N (a.k.a. K10)

This repository serves as my personal documentation in analysing the ZTE MF295N (also known as K10) router. 

The web GUI's source code is stored in `src/`, and the documentation is in `docs/`.

## Background

ZTE MF295N/K10 is a 4G LTE Cat4 mobile Wi-Fi router. The router comes with several variants with various optional features:

- External antennas
- Battery
- RJ11 port

In my case, my variant does _not_ have any of those features.

## What's known so far?

- [x] Authentication mechanism (see [Authentication](docs/Authentication.md))
- [x] Hidden web pages (see [Links](docs/Links.md))
- [ ] Shell access

This list is not exhaustive and will be updated as I learn more about the device.
